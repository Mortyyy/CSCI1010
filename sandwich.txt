Algorithm for making a PB&J sandwich.
- Import: Bread, butter knife, peanut butter, jelly, and cutting board.

- Get two (2) slices of bread. Preferably of the same type and thickness. Lay them side by side.
- Unscrew the lid on the peanut butter and, using the knife, scoop about a teaspoon of peanut butter out.
- Spread it onto one of the faces of the pieces of bread evenly. Close peanut butter jar.
- Unscrew the lid on the jelly and, using the knife, scoop about a teaspoon of jelly out.
- Spread it onto the other piece of bread (the one without the peanut butter) evenly. Close jelly jar.
- Assemble the sandwich such that the faces with the peanut butter and jelly touch.
